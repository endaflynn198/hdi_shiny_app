# HDI Shiny App

An app to demonstrate the utility of Shiny for presenting reactivate applications for data analysis. The app has built-in UN HDI data for a number of countries and allows the user to upload their own data to generate plots and tables.

The app is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean and modern design.

Feel free to check out the code and make modifications for your own Shiny apps. I have also made a video demonstration of the app below so you can see it in action and get a sense of the functionality Shiny provides. You can find this on my [website](https://endaflynn198.github.io/blog/).

## Data
Currently, the app has built-in data for the following countries:

- Nigeria
- Afghanistan
- Singapore
- India
- Japan
- Ireland

You can find further information (and datasets on more countries other than those demonstrated in the vignette) on the UN Human Development Indicators [here](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/?organization=undp-human-development-reports-office&q=Human+Development+Indicators).

The user can upload any dataset they wish to the app and the app will automatically generate the necessary plots and tables.
