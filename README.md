# HDI Shiny App
The app is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a clean and modern design.

Feel free to check out the code and make modifications for your own Shiny apps. I have also made a video demonstration of the app below so you can see it in action and get a sense of the functionality Shiny provides. You can find this on my [website](https://endaflynn198.github.io/blog/).
